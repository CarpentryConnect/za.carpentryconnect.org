            <h2>What is CarpentryConnect ZA 2021?</h2>
            <p>
                The main goal of CarpentryConnect South Africa 2021 is to <strong>build capacity for workshops through instructor training, and establish a network for the regional Carpentries community</strong>.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                CarpentryConnects are community convenings, organised to bring together community members of The Carpentries that are in close proximity geographically for knowledge exchange, collaboration, and networking.
            </p>

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The second South African CarpentryConnect will be held virtually and will bring together newer and more experienced community members to share knowledge, network, to develop new skills, and to develop strategies for building strong local communities around digital and computational literacy at universities in the country.
            </p>
